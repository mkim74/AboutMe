# Final Project 

**Description:** Create a personal site in markdown that is hosted on GitHub and provides information about you.

**Purpose:** This project provides experience working with markdown, Git/GitHub, and IT-related concepts and knowledge. As a future IT professional you will, at some time, need to create a web resource. This project and this module will provide you with an opportunity to build a web resource using one of many approaches. We will look at other approaches later in the course.

**Requirements:** This project is to be managed in a public GitHub repository. Submit the Clone with HTTPS URL for the repository that contains the personal site.  The URL is available when you click on the green Code button on a repository web page.
